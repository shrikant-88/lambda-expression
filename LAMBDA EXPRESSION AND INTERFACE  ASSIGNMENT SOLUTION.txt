LAMBDA EXPRESSION AND INTERFACE  ASSIGNMENT SOLUTION
1. A lambda expression in Java 8 is an anonymous function that can be passed to a method or used as an expression. It is a concise way to write code that would otherwise be written as a method.
2. Yes, you can pass a lambda expression to a method provided it is expecting a functional interface. A functional interface is an interface that has only one abstract method. Some examples of functional interfaces in Java 8 are Runnable, Comparator, and Predicate.
3. A functional interface in Java 8 is an interface with a single abstract method. This means that a functional interface can be implemented by a class that has only one method. This makes functional interfaces very easy to use with lambda expressions.
4. The main benefit of lambda expressions in Java 8 is that they allow you to write more concise and expressive code. Lambda expressions can also be used to make code more reusable and easier to test.
5. No, it is not mandatory for a lambda expression to have parameters. You can define a lambda expression without parameters, but it will only be able to perform a single action.
Here are some examples of lambda expressions:
(a, b) -> a + b // This lambda expression adds two numbers.
() -> System.out.println("Hello, world!") // This lambda expression prints a message to the console.
x -> x * x // This lambda expression squares a number.
